\begin{abstract}
This paper reports the results of the first survey of introductory
programming courses (N=80) taught at UK universities as part of their
first year computer science (or similar) degree programmes, conducted
in the first half of 2016. Results of this survey are compared with a
related survey conducted since 2010 (as well as earlier surveys from
2001 and 2003) in Australia and New Zealand. We report on student
numbers, programming paradigm, programming languages and
environment/tools used, as well as the reasons for choice of such.

The results in this first UK survey indicate a dominance of Java at a
time when UK universities are generally teaching students who are new
to programming (and computer science), despite the fact that Python is
perceived to be \emph{both} easier to learn and more pedagogic.

%...especially in the context of substantial computer science
% curriculum reform in UK schools, as well as increasingly scrutiny of
% teaching excellence and graduate employability for UK universities.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

For many years -- and increasingly at all levels of compulsory and
post-compulsory education -- the choice of programming language to
introduce basic programming principles, constructs, syntax and
semantics has been regularly revisited. Even in the context of what
are perceived to be the most difficult introductory topics in computer
science degrees, numerous key themes across programming frequently
appear~\cite{dale:2006}. 

So what is a good first programming language? The issues surrounding
choosing a first language~\cite{gupta:2004,kaplan:2010} -- and a
search of the ACM Digital Library identified a number of papers of the
form ``{\emph{X as a first programming language}}'', going as far back
as the 1980s -- appear to be legion, especially with discussions of
the potential impact on students' grades and
attainment~\cite{ivanovic-et-al:2015}. Decades of research on the
teaching of introductory programming has had limited effect on
classroom practice~\cite{pears-et-al:2007}; although relevant research
exists across several disciplines including education and cognitive
science, disciplinary differences have made this material inaccessible
to many computing educators. Furthermore, computer science instructors
have not had access to comprehensive surveys of research in this
area~\cite{mccracken-et-al:2001,pears-et-al:2007}.

However, in Australia and New Zealand there have been longitudinal
data
collections~\cite{deraadt-et-al:2004,mason-et-al:2012,mason+cooper:2014}
surveying the teaching of introductory programming courses in
universities. Surprisingly, such surveys have not been conducted
elsewhere on this scale, and this paper reports the findings from
running the first such similar survey in the UK.

We remind the reader that the UK consists of four nations (with an
overall population of 64.5 million: England: 54.3 million, Scotland:
5.3 million, Wales: 3.1 million and Northern Ireland: 1.8 million)
historically ruled by one parliament, but now including three devolved
assemblies responsible for the four separate education systems. In the
context of increasing international focus on curriculum and
qualification reform to support computer science education and digital
skills in schools, the four education systems of the UK have proposed
and implemented a variety of
changes~\cite{rs:2012,brown-et-al-sigcse2013,brown-et-al-toce2014},
particular in England, with a new compulsory computing curriculum for
ages 5-16 from September 2014~\cite{dfecomp:2013}. For universities
across the UK offering computer science degrees~\cite{qaacomp:2016},
this school curriculum reform has had uncertain (and emerging) impact
on the delivery of their undergraduate programmes, with the diversity
of the educational background of applicants likely to increase before
it narrows: it is certainly possible now for prospective students to
have anywhere from zero to four or five years experience (and
potentially two school qualifications) in computer science with some
knowledge of programming.

% In 1997, Scotland and Wales held referenda which determined in both
% cases the desire for self-government (along with Northern Ireland and
% the 1998 Good Friday Agreement), creating assemblies to which a
% variety of powers -- in particular, education -- were devolved from
% the UK Parliament.

Over the past three years, there has been increasing scrutiny of the
quality of teaching in UK universities, partly linked to the current
levels -- and potential future increases -- of tuition fees (generally
paid by the student through government-supported loans), as well as
relative levels of graduate employability and the perceived value of
professional body accreditation by industry. In February 2015, the UK
Department of Business, Innovation \& Skills initiated independent
reviews of STEM degree accreditation and graduate
employability\footnote{\url{https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/graduate-employment-and-accreditation-in-stem-independent-reviews}},
with a specific focus -- the Shadbolt review~\cite{shadbolt:2016} --
on computer science degree accreditation and graduate employability,
reporting back in May 2016. Alongside a number of recommendations to
address the relatively high unemployment rates of computer sciences
graduates, particular on the quality of data, course types, gender and
demographics, the Shadbolt review split generalist universities in
England into three bands, based on their average (across all subjects)
entrance tariff (qualifications of entrants); we have followed that
banding during our analysis the English results, so our data should
allow comparisons.

Thus, in this evolving environment of new policy and curricula, as
well as the emerging demands of innovative pedagogies and high-quality
learning and teaching for computer science degree programmes, we
present the findings from the first national scale survey of
introductory programming languages at UK universities. Through this
first UK wide survey of universities, we identify and analyse trends
in student numbers, programming paradigm, programming languages and
environment/tools used, as well as the reasons for choice of such are
reported.

% Other aspects of first programming courses such as instructor
% experience, 
%external delivery of courses: there was none, so irrelevant
%and resources given to students are also examined, 
% along with comparisons to the  Australasian surveys.

\section{Methodology}\label{method}

\subsection{Recruitment of Participants}

To recruit for the survey, a general call for participants was sent
out to the Council of Professors and Heads of Computing (CPHC)
membership; CPHC is the representative body for university computer
science departments in the UK, with nearly 800 members at over 100
institutions\footnote{\url{https://cphc.ac.uk/who-we-are/}}. The
survey was hosted online and was available from mid-May until the end
of June 2016; the invitation asked for the survey to be passed on to
the most appropriate person for that institution to complete it. Due
to the recruitment method, there were a number of duplicate responses
from certain departments, and these were reconciled by direct enquiry.

\begin{center}
\subimport{plots/}{langPercentCompare.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{Language popularity by percentage of courses and students (excl. OU).\label{fig:lang}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Questions}

The questions used in the survey were generously provided by the
authors of the 2013 Australia and New Zealand
survey~\cite{mason+cooper:2014}, so as to allow direct comparison
between the results of this survey. Where possible, questions were
left unchanged, although a small minority were edited to reflect the
UK target audience. As defined in the 2013 Aus/NZ survey, the
terminology ``course'' was used for ``{\emph{the basic unit of study that is
completed by students towards a degree, usually studied over a period
pf a semester or session, in conjunction with other units of study}}''.

The first section of the survey asked about the programming
language(s) in use, the reasons for their choice, and their perceived
difficulty and usefulness. Then, questions regarding the use of
environments or development tools; which ones were used, the reasons
for their choice and the perceived difficulty. General questions about
paradigm, instructor experience and external delivery were asked,
along with questions regarding students receiving unauthorised
assistance, and the resources provided to students. Finally,
participants were asked to identify their top three main aims when
teaching introductory programming, and were also allowed to provide
further comments.

% @James: I checked the paper - they could rank all reasons, not just top three.
In the 2013 Aus/NZ survey, participants were asked to rank the
importance of the given reasons for choosing a programming language,
environment or tool. Due to technical limitations in the online survey
tool used, it was not possible to do so in this survey, so
Figure~\ref{fig:reasons} only reports counts. Most questions were not
mandatory; the exceptions were ``{\emph{what programming language(s)
are in use?}}'' and a small number of feeder questions to allow the
survey to function correctly.

\section{Results and Discussion}\label{results}

\subsection{Universities and Courses}
%JHD: we need some discussion of response rates, either here or via
%Figure 1 also showing response rates, as in e-mail to Ellen

Upon completion of the survey, 155 instructors had, at least, started
the survey. Sixty-one of these dropped out before answering the
mandatory questions, and a further 14 were duplicates. Therefore, the
results presented here are drawn from the responses of 80 instructors
from at least 70 universities. Some participants did not answer all
questions and due to this the response rate varies by question.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\subimport{plots/}{reasonsByCourseCompare.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{Reasons given for choosing a programming language by percentage for: all languages; Java; and Python.\label{fig:reasons}}
\end{figure}

Excluding the Open University's 3200 students, the participants in the
survey represented 13462 students, with a mean of 173 (but a standard
deviation of 88). Looking at Figure \ref{fig:TG} we see good response
rates, apart from the specialist higher education institutions (most
of whom do not teach computing) and the ``low tariff'' English
ones. Fewer of these teach computing; this factor alone explains the
response rate. In Northern Ireland, we had responses from the two
universities, but not the university colleges, which are historically
teacher-training colleges.

\subsection{Languages}\label{langs}

%\subsubsection{Choice of Language(s)}

One of the mandatory questions in the survey, and a major point of
interest related to the programming languages in use in introductory
programming courses. Participants were asked to select languages from
a list of 22 programming languages and also had the option to choose
``{\emph{Other}}'' and specify a language not included in the list. The
majority of courses surveyed (59 out of 80) use only one programming
language, with 17 using two (and only three and one institutions using
three and four languages respectively). From the 80 courses, the total
number of {\emph{language instances}} is 106, as some courses use more
than one language to teach introductory programming.

Of the 22 languages provided, 13 were selected at least once. The
relative popularity of languages is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lang},
where the prevalence is given by the percentage of a language over all
language instances (106 total), and weighted by student numbers (16662
total). With regard to the time a language is used, of 93
language instances, the majority (65\%) are used for the whole of the
introductory programming course, 14.0\% of language instances are used
in the first part of a course and 21.5\% of language instances are
used after another programming language.

% The programming languages that were not selected at all were:
% Actionscript, Ada, Delphi, Eiffel, Fortran, jBase, Lisp, Ruby and
% Visual Basic.

\begin{center}
\subimport{plots/}{TariffByLangPercent.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{The breakdown of programming languages by Nation and Tariff Groups.\label{fig;LangTariff}}
\end{figure}

The relative popularity of languages is the immediate major difference
with the 2013 Aus/NZ survey; their survey showed a dead heat (27.3\%
of language instances) between Java and Python, with Python winning
(33.7\% to 26.9\%) when weighted by the number of students on the
course.  Our findings (Figure \ref{fig:lang}) show that Java is a
clear winner by any metric, being used in over half the courses
(61.3\%) and just under half of all language instances (46.2\%), while
the runner-up, Python, is in use in 17.5\% of courses and makes up
13.2\% of language instances. The C family (C, C++ and C\#) together
is in use in 31.3\% of introductory programming courses, and scores
23.6\% of language instances and 19.5\% by
students. Figure~\ref{fig:lang} shows the effect of student-number
weighting \emph{but} we have excluded the Open University from this
weighting, as its 3200 students learning Python (and Sense, a variant
of Scratch) would have distorted the comparison.

%\subsubsection{Reasons for choice of language}
For each language selected, participants were asked to give the
reasons for choosing that language for the introductory programming
course. Figure~\ref{fig:reasons} shows the frequency of these reasons
for all languages grouped together and for Java and Python
individually. When the reasons given are combined for all languages,
three reasons tie for first place: ``{\emph{relevance to industry}}'';
``{\emph{object-oriented language}}''; and ``{\emph{availability and
cost to students}}'', all chosen by 54.5\% of participants who
answered this question.

Looked at individually, the most popular reason given for choosing
Java is ``{\emph{object-oriented language}}'' at 87.2\%, while Python
scores highest on ``{\emph{pedagogical benefits}}'', at 72.7\%. This
may explain the popularity of Java: Java scores higher on
``{\emph{relevance to industry}}'' and, perhaps somewhat surprisingly,
much higher on ``{\emph{object-oriented language}}'' than Python,
which scores only 18.2\%.

%\subsubsection{Language choice by Nation and Tariff Score}

Figure~\ref{fig;LangTariff} breaks down the choice of language by
nation and tariff group.  It is noticeable that the three English
tariff groups differ significantly, with Python outnumbering Java in
the low tariff universities, and C being almost exclusively in the
high tariff universities.


%\subsubsection{Perceived difficulty and usefulness to fundamental concepts}
%{\bf{@James: Need to say something about Fig 4: difficulty and usefulness.}}

Figure \ref{fig:utility} gives the instructors' views on languages. It
is noteworthy that Java is among the most difficult, and not among the
pedagogically most useful.

\begin{center}
\subimport{plots/}{ParadigmByLangPercent.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{The breakdown of the main paradigm in use for each programming language.\label{fig:paradigmLang}}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Paradigm Taught}

Instructors were asked what paradigm was being taught in their
introductory programming course, regardless of what is traditionally
thought to apply to the language(s) in use. This question,
understandably, caused some dissatisfaction in the comments section,
with many participants noting that more than paradigm is taught in
their course. Although this was to be expected, we wanted to be able
to directly compare our results to the 2013 Aus/NZ survey, and so did
not alter the question. The most popular paradigm is object-oriented
with 50\% (N=40) followed by procedural (N=27, 33.8\%) and functional
(N=7, 8.75\%); logical was also offered as a choice but was not
selected.

%\subsubsection{Paradigm by nation and tariff score}
The results of the previous question were used to analyse
(Figure~\ref{fig:paradigmTariff}) the prevalence of paradigms across
nations and tariff score groups. Caution must be applied when
interpreting these results, as participants could only choose one
paradigm, even though more may be in use.
%{\bf{[@James: Need to add some commentary here.]}}

%\subsubsection{Paradigm by language}

In the same way as above, the languages chosen were analysed
(Figure~\ref{fig:paradigmLang}) with regard to the main paradigm in
use. Again, caution must be applied, as for a given course, only one
paradigm is chosen, even though more than one language and/or paradigm
may be in use. This explains the respondents who used C, but stated
that OO was the main paradigm, for example. More surprising is the
fact that Python was almost exclusively viewed as procedural.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Instructor Experience}

Participants were asked: ``{\emph{How many years have you been
involved in teaching of introductory programming?}}''. The results,
shown in Table~\ref{tab:yearsTeaching}, indicate that of the survey
participants, the average was between 10-20 years.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{IDEs and Tools}

%\subsubsection{Choice of tool/IDE}

Participants in the survey were asked if they encouraged students in
the first programming course to use environments and/or tools beyond
simple text editors and command line compilers. The majority of
participants of this question (74.4\% of 78 instructors) responded
that they did encourage tools. Of the 58 instructors that did select a
tool/IDE, the majority (58.6\%) use only one, with 25.8\% and 10.3\%
using two and three respectively; very few (5.2\%) used four or more,
with one respondent using eight.

% \caption{The number of tools/environments used in first programming courses.\ref{tab:numTools}}
% \label{tab:numTools}
% \begin{tabular}{cccccc}

\subimport{plots/}{reasonsByCourseCompareTool.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{Reasons given for choosing a tool or environment by percentage for: all tools and environments; BlueJ; and Eclipse.\label{fig:reasonsTools}}
\end{figure}

The survey asked participants to select the tools and IDEs in use in
their introductory programming course out of a list of 24, which the
option to specify ``{\emph{Other}}''. Of the 24 provided, 12 were
chosen at least once. The relative popularity of IDEs and tools is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tools}. The most popular tool/IDE in the
survey was Eclipse, reported in 37.5\% of courses and scoring 25.0\%
of tool/IDE instances, and 26.8\% when weighted by students. Following
this is ``{\emph{No Tool/IDE}}'', which accounts for 27.5\% of
courses. The second most popular tool/IDE is BlueJ, which was reported
in 22.5\% of courses and scored 15.0\% of tool/IDE instances, and
15.5\% when weighted by students. Participants were also asked why
each tool/IDE was chosen for their course, and asked to select from a
list of reasons. The results of this are give in
Figure~\ref{fig:reasonsTools}, for all tools and IDEs grouped
together, and for the two most popular choices, Eclipse and BlueJ.

%The tools and IDEs not selected at all were: AdaCore, Alice, App, Browser, Greenfoot, Jeroo, Jython, KTechLab, MySQL, Pelles, Quincy, Wing101 and Xcode.

%\subsubsection{Reasons for choice of tool/IDE}


\subsubsection{Reuse of Tool/IDE}

Instructors were also asked whether the tool/IDE was used for an
initial part of the first programming course or throughout the whole
of the course; and whether it was used in any other course in the
degree (Figure~\ref{fig:toolreuse}). 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\subimport{plots/}{timingOtherCourseTool.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{For each tool or environment, whether it is used: for an initial part of the first programming course; throughout the whole of the first programming course; in any other course in the degree.\label{fig:toolreuse}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Difficulty of Tool/IDE}

In addition to this, instructors were asked to rate how difficult
{\emph{they}} found the tool/IDE on a Likert scale from
``{\emph{Extremely Easy}}'' (1) to ``{\emph{Extremely Difficult}}''
(7), and also how difficult they believed {\emph{the students}} found
the tool/IDE, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:toolhard}.

\begin{center}
\subimport{plots/}{DifficultyYouStudentsCompareTools.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{The median difficulty rating of tool for the instructor and students to use, where 1 is `extremely easy' and 7 is `extremely difficult'.  %Answers must have been given by at least two instructors.
\label{fig:toolhard}}
\end{figure}

We note that, while Eclipse is the most popular tool by some way, it
is also deemed to be most difficult. This, apparently perverse,
practice might be explained by the extent of re-use of Eclipse in
other courses.

%{\bf{[@James: Any other commentary on tools/IDEs?]}}


\subsection{Other Aspects of the Course}

\subsubsection{External Delivery}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\subimport{plots/}{Steps.tex}
\end{center}
\caption{Steps taken to determine whether students have received unauthorised assistance on assignments.\label{fig:Plagiarise}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Resources provided to students}

The questionnaire asked about the resources in terms of examples,
books etc. provided to students. The results are rather similar to the
2013 Aus/NZ survey~\cite[Figure 14]{mason+cooper:2014} so we do not
repeat that here.


%\subsubsection{Unauthorised assistance}
We asked participants: ``{\emph{What steps do you take to try to
determine whether students have received unauthorised assistance on
assignments?}}''. The details are in the full paper\footnote{The full
paper will shortly be available on arXiv.}, but range from
``{\emph{notice unlikely similarities}}'' (59.1\% of the 66
instructors who responded to this question) to ``{\emph{interview some
students/groups at random}}'', selected by only five instructors.

%{\bf @Ellen: is this right - I've corrected the percentage and now it is.} 


% {\bf{[@James: this was one of the questions given to me by Raina, but it's possible that it was only added to the list after [8] was published. So might not be correct to say that it was asked by them.]}} 
We report our results in Figure~\ref{fig:Plagiarise}, as we think they
are of general interest.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Aims of an Introductory Programming Course}

The 2013 Aus/NZ survey asked their respondents for the aims of their
introductory programming course. They, and we, asked for (up to) three
aims. The authors then attempted to classify the free-text answers
into the same categorisation as \cite{mason+cooper:2014} used. While
it is trivial to map the written aim ``{\emph{Thinking
algorithmically}}'' to ``{\emph{Algorithmic
thinking}}''~\cite{mason+cooper:2014} and so on, many were not so
clear: for example, we mapped ``{\emph{To learn a specific
language}}'' to ``{\emph{Syntax/writing basic code}}''. There were
also a class of aims, such as ``{\emph{Establish professional software
development practices}}'', that seemed very coherent, but did not map
clearly to the \cite{mason+cooper:2014} aims. These we have
categorised as ``{\emph{Software Engineering}}''. Results of this
question are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:aims}.

\section{General Discussion}\label{discussion}

\subsection{The UK Context}

As presented in Section~\ref{langs}, our findings show that Java is
the most popular introductory programming language in UK universities,
more than twice as popular as Python in second place; the C family of
languages (C, C++ and C\#) together is in use in nearly a third of
introductory programming courses. We were surprised by the viewpoint
expressed of Python, as a multi-paradigm language, as being largely
procedural; from the authors' experiences, the dominance of Java has
been a trend for the past ten years, but we would expect to see a
steady increase in Python due to influences from the changes to school
curricula in the UK~\cite{brown-et-al-toce2014}.

We note that from a smaller survey conducted in July 2014, Python is
the most popular language for teaching introductory computer science
courses at top-ranked US university departments; specifically, eight
of the top 10 CS departments (80\%), and 27 of the top 39 (69\%),
teach Python in introductory CS0 or CS1 courses~\cite{guo:2014}.  This
together with \cite{mason+cooper:2014} and Figure \ref{fig:utility}
might make one question the UK's domination by Java.

% should we mention TEF here?
From a UK policy perspective, a new national Teaching Excellence
Framework\footnote{\url{http://www.hefce.ac.uk/lt/tef/}} has been
proposed, with a core ambition to ``{\emph{to raise the quality and
status of teaching in higher education institutions}}''; excellence is
to be measured through a series of proxy metrics that include student
satisfaction, retention and graduate employability. There have been
significant concerns about the aims of the framework, as well as the
suitability of the metrics; it remains to be seen how this will affect
computer science curricula in UK institutions going forward,
especially if there is renewed demand for meeting the immediate (but

The UK's Higher Education Academy -- the national body which champions
teaching quality -- has previously supported initiatives for improving
learning \& teaching in computer science, including innovative
pedagogies for
programming~\cite{crick-et-al-hea:2015,davenport-et-al:latice2016},
but we have not yet seen the desired cascading of best practice and
wider national impact.

\subsection{Comparison with Australasia}

Here we compare with the latest Australasian
survey~\cite{mason+cooper:2014}. We have already commented on the
major difference in language choice, which colours many of the other
comparisons. In fact, the UK's language choices seem more similar to
Australasia's 2010 choices~\cite{mason-et-al:2012} and \cite[Table
4]{mason+cooper:2014} than even Australasia's 2013 choices. It is hard
to know which comes first, but we also notice that our
difficulty/utility data (Figure \ref{fig:utility}) is somewhat
different from \cite[Figures 7/8]{mason+cooper:2014}

Another difference shows up in the tools/environments are: Figure
\ref{fig:tools} versus \cite{mason+cooper:2014}'s Figure 11. There,
``{\emph{None}}'' and ``{\emph{Other}}'' were the top two categories,
with IDLE, at 15\%, the most popular named product. In the UK,
``{\emph{None}}'' is second, ``{\emph{Other}}'' is sixth and IDLE
eighth. Eclipse, the UK favourite, was an ``also ran'' in
\cite{mason+cooper:2014}.
