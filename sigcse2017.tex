\begin{abstract}
This paper reports the results of a survey of xx introductory
programming courses delivered at UK universities as part of their
first year computer science (or similar) degree programmes, conducted
in the first half of 2016. Results of this survey are compared with a
related survey conducted since 2010 (as well as earlier surveys from
2001 and 2003) on universities in Australia and New Zealand. Trends in
student numbers, programming paradigm, programming languages and
environment/tools used, as well as the reasons for choice of such are
reported. Other aspects of first programming courses such as
instructor experience, external delivery of courses and resources
given to students are also examined.

The results indicate a trend towards...
