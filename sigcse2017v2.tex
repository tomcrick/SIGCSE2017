\begin{abstract}
This paper reports the results of a survey of xx introductory
programming courses delivered at UK universities as part of their
first year computer science (or similar) degree programmes, conducted
in the first half of 2016. Results of this survey are compared with a
related survey conducted since 2010 (as well as earlier surveys from
2001 and 2003) on universities in Australia and New Zealand. Trends in
student numbers, programming paradigm, programming languages and
environment/tools used, as well as the reasons for choice of such are
reported. Other aspects of first programming courses such as
instructor experience, external delivery of courses and resources
given to students are also examined.

The results indicate a trend towards...

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

\cite{mason+cooper:2014} is the latest in a long line \cite{deraadt-et-al:2004,mason-et-al:2012} of papers surveying the teaching of introductory programming courses in Australasia. However, such surveys are not the norm elsewhere, and this paper reports the authors' findings from running the first such survey in the United Kingdom. We remind the reader that in the United Kingdom (population 63.2 million \cite{Census}), Higher Education is the responsibility of the Westminster Goverment in England (53 million) and of the devolved goverments in Scotland (5.3 million), Wales (3.1 million) and Northern Ireland (1.8 million).

UK policy context
e.g. schools~\cite{brown-et-al-sigcse2013,brown-et-al-toce2014},
Shadbolt/Wakeham,
The Shadbolt enquiry split generalist universities in England in three bands, based on their average (across al subjects) entrance tariff (qualifications of entrants), and we have followed that banding when we split the English results, so our data should be comparable with \cite{shadbolt:2016}

 TEF, graduate employability, etc.

space~\cite{mccracken-et-al:2001,gupta:2004,dale:2006,pears-et-al:2007,guo:2014}

\section{Methodology}\label{method}

\subsection{Recruitment of Participants}

To recruit participants for the survey, a general invitation email was sent to the Council of Professors and Heads of Computing (CPHC) mailing list. CPHC have members from over 100 UK universities, and are the representational body for this group in the UK\footnote{\texttt{https://cphc.ac.uk/who-we-are/}}.The invitation asked for the survey to be passed on to the most appropriate person to fill it out; Director of Studies, Chair of Teaching Committee or the best fit for the individual institution. A couple of reminder circular e-mails were also issued.

The survey was hosted online, and was open from mid-May until the end of June 2016, at which point it was closed and the results were downloaded and analysed. Due to the recruitment method, there were duplicate responses from some departments, and these were reconciled by direct enquiry.
\subsection{Questions}

The questions used in the survey were generously provided by the authors of~\cite{mason+cooper:2014}, so as to allow direct comparison between the results of this survey and that of the Australian/New Zealand 2014 survey. Where possible, questions were left unchanged, although a small minority were edited to reflect the UK target audience. 

As written in~\cite{mason+cooper:2014}, text in the survey made clear that the terminology ``course'' was used for ``the basic unit of study that is completed by students towards a degree, usually studied over a period pf a semester or session, in conjunction with other units of study''. 

%JHD: next line says "difficulty of usefulness" --- do we mean "difficulty and usefulness"?
The first section of the survey asked about the programming language(s) in use, the reasons for their choice, and the perceived difficulty of usefulness of the programming language(s). Following this were questions regarding the use of environments or development tools; which ones were used, the reasons for their choice and the perceived difficulty. General questions about paradigm, instructor experience and external delivery were asked, along with questions regarding students receiving unauthorised assistance, and the resources provided to students. Finally, participants were asked to identify their top three main aims when teaching introductory programming, and were also allowed to provide further comments. 

In~\cite{mason+cooper:2014}, participants were asked to rank the importance of the given (up to three) reasons for choosing a programming language, environment or tool. Due to technical limitations in online survey tool used, it was not possible to do so in this survey, so our Figure{fig:reasons} just reports counts.

\section{Results and Discussion}\label{results}

\subsection{Universities and Courses}
JHD: we need some discussion of response rates, either here or via Figure 1 also showing response rates, as in e-mail to Ellen

\subsection{Student Numbers}
??
\subsection{Languages}
This is the immediate major difference with \cite{mason+cooper:2014}. Their survey showed a dead heat (27.3\% of courses) between Java and Python, with Python winning (33.7\% to 26.9\%) when weighted by the number of students on the course.  Our findings  (Figure \ref{fig:lang}) show that Java is a clear winner by any metric, being used in over half the courses, while the runner-up, Python, is in use in under 20\%. Figure \ref{fig:lang} shows very little effect of student-number weighting \emph{but} we have excluded the Open University from this weighting, as its 3240 students learning purely Java (@Ellen: am I right) would probably have distorted the comparison.

\end{figure}
\par
Figure \ref{fig:reasons} shows some of the reasons for this: Java scores higher on ``relevance to industry'' and, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, much higher on ``ObjectOriented language''.  @Tom: do you agree with ``somewhat surprisingly''?

Figure \ref{fig;LangTariff} breaks down the choice of language by nation and tariff group.  It is noticeable that the three English tariff groups differ significantly, with Python outnumbering Java in the low tariff universities, and C being almost exclusively in the hogh tariff universities.

\subsection{Aims of an Introductory Programming Course}
 \cite{mason+cooper:2014} asked their respondents for the aims of their introductory programming course. They asked for (up to) three aims, but ??Ellen: I thought you said they just used one, but looking at the headcount in the firgure, it looks like all three?? in their Figure 15. As part of our policy of reproducing  \cite{mason+cooper:2014} as closely as possible, we asked the same. The authors then attempted to classify the free-text answers into the same categorisation as  \cite{mason+cooper:2014} used. While it is trivial to map the written aim ``Thinking algorithmically'' to \cite{mason+cooper:2014}'s ``Algorithmic thinking'' and so on, many were not so clear: for example, we mapped ``To learn a specific language'' to ``syntax/writing basic code''. There were also a class of aims, such as ``Establish professional software development practices'', that seemed very coherent, but didn't map clearly to the \cite{mason+cooper:2014} aims. These we have categorised as ``Software Engineering''.
